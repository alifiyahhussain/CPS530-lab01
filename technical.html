            1. Here is the html code for lab01: <a href="./code.txt">lab1.html</a><br>
            2. Inorder to password protect my page I used a script from W3schools -- where the correct password is saved in a variable, while an another variable is used to prompt the user to enter the password. If they match then it displays the webpage, if not, it redirects them somewhere else, in my case the neopets website.<br>
            3. &lt;i&gt; &lt;\i&gt; this tag makes text italic. I used it for my navbar just for aesthetic purposes. I've used all the other tags before<br>
            4. I tried on both Safari and Chrome and it looked the same and resized the same. It looks different on a phone and an ipad though because of how it resizes according to browser dimensions.<br>
            5. I spent about 6 hours on this lab. I have pretty minimal experience with HTML from a few years ago where I was just sort of playing around, trying things, and seeing how they change the page. I’m taking this class to learn how do to everything properly, rather than just doing guess work. I was still pretty unsure on how to do things so far thats why this lab took me longer than I expected. Googled a bunch of things, however I couldn’t seem to find proper solutions for a few things. For example, trying to get the nav bar and grid in the center (I really don’t understand how to place things in relation to each other and the page along with making it responsive, but I really want to learn so I can make a pretty portfolio (the artwork in here is mine)).
